# InnManager

InnManager is an Angular 18 application designed to manage rooms for hotels, lodges, and similar accommodations. It leverages the latest features of Angular and uses PrimeNG for a responsive and rich UI experience. This project was created as a practice tool to explore room management systems and modern Angular development.
